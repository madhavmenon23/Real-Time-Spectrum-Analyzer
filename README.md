This project can be used to analyze the frequency spectrum of an audio signal in real-time and visualize it in graphical format.

This can be achieved in two ways:
1) Running the "Freq_Analyzer(built-iin_mic).mlx" file in Matlab which uses the laptop microphone
2) Running the "Mic_data_transmitter.ino" file in Arduino IDE to take audio data from an external microphone and send it to laptop via serial communication, and the "Freq_Analyzer(external_mic&arduino).mlx" file in Matlab to proceess the received data.

The project report is made available which is to be checked for further details.
